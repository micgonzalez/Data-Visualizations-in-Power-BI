# Findings
I was amazed by the amount of options and outcomes from Power BI and my data source. As you can see in my preview section, I was able to pull out some interesting visualizations. 

# Challenges
The layout of Power BI was a little tricky for me, after a while I was able to understand it. Power BI has many functions that can give you an overwhelming feeling on the visualization choices.

# Conclusion
In Power BI, you are able to use many types of data sources that don't require additional steps. Power BI many useful functions that allows me to transform the given text file into data visualizations.
